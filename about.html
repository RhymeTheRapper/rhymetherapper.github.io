            I started out as a data science major in college but quickly fell in love with programming. I decided to
            switch to a more computer science focused career and flourished. With my mainly STEM focused courses I felt
            that I was missing something major in my learning. Design enabled me to create things that were both
            technical and beautiful. The more I learned in school, the more I felt compelled to pursue user focused
            design. So much of our world is designed badly, for aesthetic or purpose but not both. I want to create
            products that work for all users and look amazing.
